# The "why now" for AI edtech is superlearning

Tech influencers love to talk about how education technology (edtech) landscape is ripe for disruption, yet many struggle to identify breakout use cases for AI in this domain. While numerous AI edtech companies focus on helping students cheat, automating busywork for teachers, or providing "personalized learning paths" for enterprises, there is an often-overlooked opportunity that holds the key to revolutionizing education: superlearning - the ability to accelerate human learning by 10 times or more.

## The limitations of traditional edtech

To understand why superlearning is the future of AI in edtech, we must first examine the limitations of the current education system and the edtech solutions designed to fit within its constraints. The Industrial Revolution model of education, which emphasizes standardization, conformity, and a one-size-fits-all approach to learning, remains prevalent today. In this system, grades, rather than genuine understanding and application of knowledge, have become the primary incentive for students.

Many existing edtech companies perpetuate this flawed paradigm by focusing on helping students achieve better grades through cheating or automating busywork. Even "personalized learning" solutions often simply provide a more streamlined way to progress through a standardized curriculum, failing to truly adapt to individual needs and learning styles. Moreover, the high-pressure, high-stakes environment created by the emphasis on grades can lead to stress, anxiety, and a lack of intrinsic motivation for learning.

By designing solutions that fit within the constraints of the current system, such as the traditional school day, subject divisions, and individual work, edtech companies limit their ability to drive genuine transformation in education. Furthermore, they may overlook the needs of learners outside traditional educational pathways, such as adult learners, career changers, or those in developing countries with limited access to formal schooling.

## Superlearning

The key to unlocking the full potential of AI in edtech lies in targeting users with a strong intrinsic motivation to learn quickly, such as those acquiring new skills for professional or personal reasons. By building products that cater to this need, edtech companies can break free from the limitations of the traditional system and create solutions that prioritize genuine learning, adapt to individual needs, and provide access to education for all.

Two shining examples of this approach are Speak, a language learning app, and Synaptiq, an AI-powered platform for medical students. Speak leverages advanced natural language processing and speech recognition AI to create immersive, context-based conversations that enable users to practice speaking in real-world scenarios, resulting in learning speeds up to 100 times faster than traditional language learning apps. By focusing on users who need fluency as soon as possible, particularly in markets like South Korea where English tutoring is highly valued, Speak has achieved explosive revenue growth and rapid product-market fit.

Similarly, Synaptiq, a Y Combinator-backed startup, uses AI and neuroscience principles to help medical students learn 10 times faster. By optimizing the timing and format of information delivery, Synaptiq's algorithms maximize retention and minimize forgetting, enabling students to absorb vast amounts of medical knowledge quickly. With adoption in over 220 medical schools and hospitals across 85 countries and impressive month-over-month growth, Synaptiq is poised to become the AI infrastructure for the $110 billion medical education industry, ultimately leading to better-trained physicians, a more efficient healthcare system, and improved patient care.

## Conclusion

The "why now" for AI in edtech is clear: superlearning represents a transformative opportunity to unlock the full potential of technology in education. By targeting users with a strong need to learn quickly and designing solutions that prioritize genuine understanding and adaptability, edtech companies can break free from the limitations of the traditional education system. While challenges exist, the vast potential for AI-powered superlearning across various domains positions it as a key driver of growth and innovation in the edtech industry for years to come. The future of education lies in our ability to harness the power of AI to accelerate learning and make it accessible to all.
